This contains python code for the Discrete Wigner Function Calculator.

The main reference is Hudson's Theorem for Finite-Dimensional Quantum Systems by David Gross, available at https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0602001

Currently, (Wednesday, May 20th, 2020) I have implemented finite fields and with an interface to draw lines over the affine plane.

By the end of June, I hope to have a full app which calculates and displays the Wigner Function for a state, computes the marginals with respect to striations, and so forth.
